global array of bone transform matrices in vertex buffer

extra vertex attributes - 4 bone indices, 4 bone weights

cpu side - per animated object - compute bone transforms by interpolating over key frames, send to GPU during rendering

gpu side - per vertex - compute weighted sum of bone matrices and apply to the model matrix? or apply to vertex before model
